>Create a realistic 2D traffic simulation within a single HTML file using the HTML5 canvas element for rendering. The simulation should feature basic but clear visuals to depict vehicles and road elements accurately. Implement smooth vehicle movements, realistic traffic >flow behavior including acceleration, deceleration, stopping at signals or avoiding collisions, and lane changing if applicable. Use JavaScript embedded directly in the HTML file to manage the simulation logic and rendering.
>
># Steps
>- Set up an HTML file containing a canvas element sized appropriately for the simulation.
>- Define roads, lanes, and intersections as part of the simulation environment.
>- Create vehicle objects with properties such as position, speed, direction, and size.
>- Implement vehicle behavior including starting, stopping, and lane following.
>- Add realistic traffic flow dynamics like maintaining distance, reacting to traffic controls, and preventing collisions.
>- Animate the simulation smoothly using requestAnimationFrame or similar.
>
># Output Format
>Provide the complete HTML file code as plain text, with embedded JavaScript and CSS if needed, fully self-contained and ready to run in a web browser.
